 # Income Inequality and Human Capital  - Demo oTree Lab Experiment
 
 
 This oTree installation is part of the experiment by *Villamizar(2019)*. It allows participants to invest part of
 their earnings from counting "a"s in a Real Effort Task (RET) in order to improve their chances of winning a prize 
 trough a Tullock contest. For more information about the functioning of the experiment 
 please refer to *Villamizar (2019)*.

 If you want to use this experiment in full or in part for your own purposes, feel free to do so.
 Just make sure you quote *Villamizar (2019)*.

 1. In Terminal or PowerShell go to the folder you want to install the experiment in, for instance ```cd user_folder```.
 1. Make sure you have "numpy" installed with ```pip install numpy``` or ```pip3 install numpy``` if you use Python 3.
