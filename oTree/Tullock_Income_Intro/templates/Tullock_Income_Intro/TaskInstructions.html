        During the experiment, you will be asked to count letters. You have to count <strong>how many</strong> times the letter “<strong>a</strong>“
        appears in a sequence of characters.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next screen you will have the opportunity to try the task five times. You will face sequences of various lengths to get a good impression of the task.
        To submit an answer, hit the <span class="badge badge-info"> ⏎ Enter</span> key.
        If your answer is correct, the next sequence is displayed. Otherwise, the same sequence is displayed again and you can submit another answer.
        The timer in blue above each sequence indicates for how long you have been counting the "a"s of the <strong>current sequence</strong>.
        This timer will restart with every new sequence of characters.
        The yellow timer next to the input field indicates how long you needed to solve the <strong>previous sequence</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the next screen you will find an annotated tour that shows where you can find all the relevant information elements (Timers, Sequence and Input Field).
